# IR-Project

> This repository doesn't contain the index files, which need to be created in the GCP using the relevant code.
> It also doesn't include the general dictionaries (doc id to title, doc id to page views, doc id to page rank and doc id to combined page rank and page views,
> which also need to be created using the relevant code - on the local machine

This project implements a search engine one the whole english wikipedia corpus. Given a query, it finds the most relevant documents.
The query could be any free text, to be searched on the body/title/anchor of the articles, or on the combination of them.
It also can support queries, that include doc id, and asks for the page rank and page views of the documents.
The service is ran by a flask server, which is deployed on a google cloud VM instance. The server supports 6 different http requests on port 8080:
search, search_body, search_anchor, search_title, get_pageview and get_pagerank.
The engine clears the query, tokenizes and stems it, addes 2 word n-grams to it, and finally searches the relevant documents in the inverted index -
which contains a score for each combination of a word and document, using the bm25 algorithm. In the calculation, the page views of each document
are also considered.

## Inverted Index Structure
To access the inverted index file, first the "index.pkl" should be read with pickle. This file contains all the global data of the index:
- AVGDL : Average document length of the whole corpus
- posting_locs: A dictionary, which maps each word to name of the correlated bin file - which contains the whole posting list, and to the offset of the posting list in the file.
- df: A dictionary, which maps each word to the document frequence of each word.
The index also contain the bin files - which hold the binary data each word posting list.

## Posting List Structure
### Small Indexes 
Each posting list contains a list of tuples, where each tuple has 4 elements:
- doc_id: The id of the document in wikipedia.
- tf: The term frequence of the term in the document.
- max_tf: The max_tf of the whole document.
- doc_lent: The length of the document.
These elements are used for calculations and experiments

### Title and Anchor indexes
Each posting list contains a list of integers, where each integer is a document id.

### TF-IDF Body Index and BM25 Merged Index:
Each posting list contains a list of tuples, where each tuple has 2 elements:
- doc_id: The id of the document in wikipedia.
- score: The score of the word in the specific document, calculated by TF-IDF/BM25 formula.

## Project Structure
### create_big_indexes
This folder contains needed files to create all the big indexes (on the whole corpus), which are finally used to build the current engine.
#### Jupyter notebooks
These jupyter notebooks should be ran on a cluster of the gcp service. They use pyspark kernel to create the index mentioned in the file name, in a distributed calculation.
They save the index to a bucket in the gcp.
#### Python files
These modules contain the InvertedIndex class of the corresponding index, and the Reader and Writed classes, which are used to read/write to the bucket.

---
### create_small_indexes
#### Jupyter notebooks
These notebooks are used to create the small indexes which are used for the experiments. There are 2 notebooks - one for the colab (to test it on a small portion of files), and one for the gcp - for the creation of the index.
#### Inverted Index python files
These files contain the classes of the InvertedIndex, and the Reader and Writer classes.
#### merge_one_word_with_two_word.py
This module is used to merge one-word index, with the two-word index, which were created seperatly on the same corpus.

---
### experiments_on_small_index
This folder contains experiments on the small indexes, which helped us to choose the best parameters and best weights for the parts of the engine.

---
### front_end
This folder contains the code which is deployed and ran on the Google VM.
#### search_frontend.py
This file contains the flask app which recieves http requests for queries, and returns the results for them.
#### inverted_index.py files 
This file contains the InvertedIndex classes for the corresponding index - The TF-IDF body index, The title/anchor index and the merged bm25 index.
#### anchor_title_simple_search.py
This file handles the http request of search_title and search_anchor - it uses a binary retreival model, to find the documents in which the query terms appeared the most and at least once.
#### best_search_function_for_frontend.py
